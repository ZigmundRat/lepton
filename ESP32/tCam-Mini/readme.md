## tCam-Mini
tCam-Mini was created using code from the tCam project and ended up being finished first.  It is a simple device, hardware-wise, consisting of an ESP32 WROVER module, USB UART for programming and debug, Lepton 3.5 and supporting voltage regulators and oscillator.

![tCam-Mini Front and Back](pictures/tcam_mini_pcb_r2.png)

It has a I2C expansion port that I intend to use to explore adding additional sensing capability such as humidity, distance and lens temperature to increase the camera's accuracy.

### Firmware
The "Firmware" directory contains a V4.0.2 Espressif ESP32 IDF project for tCam-Mini. You should be able to build and load it into a camera using the IDF commands (I still use "make program monitor").  There are also a set of precompiled binaries in the "precompiled" sub-directory.  You can use the Espressif tool and instructions found in the "programming" directory in parallel to this one to load those into a camera without having to build the project.

Note: The precompiled firmware and Windows-based programming application can be downloaded directly from my [website](http://danjuliodesigns.com/products/tcam_mini.html) as well if you don't want to clone this entire repository.

#### FW 2.1 (2/5/2022)
FW revision 2.1 fixes the following issues.  It is designed to run on the tCam-Mini PCBs with Revision 3 silicon and 8 MB Flash memory (camera's built using Revision 1 silicon or less than 8 MB Flash memory should use FW revision 1.3).  It fixes an issue where setting a password of less than 8 characters would brick the tCam-Mini (requiring reload of firwmare using the Windows utility).

1. Prevent updating Wifi password if the length is less than 8 characters to avoid a condition where the ESP32 wifi library fails on boot and the camera can't be reconfigured.
2. Add the ability to reset wifi even when the camera has detected a hardware fault on boot (backup solution to #1 above).

#### FW 2.0 (11/23/2021)
FW revision 2.0 adds the following new features.  It is designed to run on the tCam-Mini PCBs with Revision 3 silicon and 8 MB Flash memory (camera's built using Revision 1 silicon or less than 8 MB Flash memory should use FW revision 1.3).

1. Faster performance - often reaching the full 8.7 fps over wifi
2. Support for Lepton 3.0 (as well, of course for Lepton 3.5 and FS)
3. Support for OTA FW updates (from the Desktop Application 2.0).  After 2.0 is loaded they wonâ€™t have to use the serial IF and Espressif utility to load new firmware releases.
4. Support for a new HW Slave interface (available on the next revision of HW) for direct connect to another Micro (I use this for tCam).

### Hardware
The "Hardware" directory contains PCB gerbers, stencil gerbers, a BOM and a schematic PDF.  These can be used to build a tCam-Mini on the PCB I designed.  Of course you can also buy a pre-assembled unit from [Group Gets](https://store.groupgets.com/products/tcam-mini) with or without the Lepton.  See below for instructions on building one from commonly available development boards.

Note: My interests are in radiometric thermography so I have focused primarily on the Lepton 3.5.  The Lepton 3.0 is supported starting with FW 2.0.  It should be possible for someone to modify my firmware source to work with the Lepton 2 and 2.5 models by modifying the task that reads the lepton (probably easiest to modify the code that reads the data and then just pixel-double it before handing it off to other tasks).  I will be happy to include a link to anyone else's clone of my code that supports these older Leptons.

### Operation
tCam-Mini is a command-based device.  It is designed for software running on another device to control it and receive responses and image data from it.  The software communicates with tCam-Mini via a socket interface with commands, responses and images encoded as json packets.  Data is not encrypted so appropriate care should be taken.

#### USB Port
The USB Port provides a USB Serial interface supporting automatic ESP32 reset and boot-mode entry for programming.  It is also used for serial logging output by the ESP32 firmware (115,200 baud).

#### WiFi
tCam-Mini can act as either an Access Point (creating its own WiFi network) or a client (connecting to an existing WiFi network).  It acts as an Access Point (AP) by default.  It selects an SSID based on a unique MAC ID in the ESP32 with the form "tCam-Mini-HHHH" where "HHHH" are the last four hexadecimal digits of the MAC ID.  There is no password by default.  When acting as an Access Point, each tCam-Mini always has the same default IPV4 address (192.168.4.1).

It can be reconfigured via a command (for example, from the desktop application) to act as a WiFi Client (STAtion mode) and connect to an existing WiFi network.  When configured as a WiFi Client, it can either get a DHCP served address from the network's router or it can also be reconfigured to have a fixed (static) IPV4 address.  Using a static address makes it easier to connect to tCam-Mini because you don't have to find out what DHCP address the router gave it by logging into the router or using a utility like the Fing Android app or nmap on Linux.

Currently only one device can connect to the camera at a time.

Please see the set of instructions in the DesktopApp folder in this repository for connecting to tCam-Mini in either mode.

#### WiFi Reset Button
Pressing and holding the WiFi Reset Button for more than five seconds resets the WiFi interface back to the default AP mode.  The status indicator will blink a pattern indicating the reset has occurred (see below).

Pressing the button quickly when a OTA FW update has been requested (LED alternating red/green) by the Desktop application initiates the update process.

#### Status Indicator
A dual-color (red/green) LED is used to communicate status.  Combinations of color and blinking patterns communicate various information.

| Status Indicator | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Off or Dim | Firmware did not start |
| Solid Red | Firmware is running: initializing and configuring the Lepton and WiFi |
| Blinking Yellow | AP Mode : No client connected to camera's WiFi |
|  | Client Mode : Not connected to an AP |
| Solid Yellow | AP Mode : Client connected to camera'sWiFi |
|  | Client Mode : Connected to an AP |
| Solid Green | WiFi is connected and external software has connected via the socket interface|
| Fast Blink Yellow | WiFi Reset in progress |
| Alternating Red/Green | Over-the-air FW update has been requested.  Press the button to initiate the update |
| Blinking Green | FW update in process |
| Series of Red Blinks | A fault has been detected.  The number of blinks indicate the fault type (see table below) |


| Fault Blinks | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 blink | ESP32 I2C or SPI peripheral initialization failed |
| 2 blinks | ESP32 Non-volatile storage or WiFi initialization failed |
| 3 blinks | ESP32 static memory buffer allocation failed (potential PSRAM issue) |
| 4 blinks | Lepton CCI communication failed (I2C interface) |
| 5 blinks | Lepton VoSPI communication failed (SPI interface) |
| 6 blinks | Internal network error occurred |
| 7 blinks | Lepton VoSPI synchronization cannot be achieved |
| 8 blinks | Over-the-air FW Update failed |

Additional start-up and fault information is available from the USB Serial interface.

### Command Interface
The camera is capable of executing a set of commands and generating responses or sending image data when connected to a remote computer via the WiFi interface.  It can support one remote connection at a time.  Commands and responses are encoded as json-structured strings.  The command interface exists as a TCP/IP socket at port 5001.

Each json command or response is delimited by two characters.  A start delimitor (value 0x02) preceeds the json string.  A end delimitor (value 0x03) follows the json string.  The json string may be tightly packed or may contain white space.  However no command may exceed 256 bytes in length.

```<0x02><json string><0x03>```

The camera currently supports the following commands.  The communicating application should wait for a response from commands that generate one before issuing subsequent commands (although the camera does have some buffering - 1024 bytes - for multiple commands).

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| get_status | Returns a packet with camera status.  The application uses this to verify communication with the camera. |
| get_image | Returns a packet with metadata, radiometric (or AGC) image data and Lepton telemetry objects. |

| set_config | Set the camera's settings. |
| set\_lep_cci | Writes specified data to the Lepton's CCI interface. |
| set_spotmeter | Set the spotmeter location in the Lepton.  Does  not return anything. |
| set\_stream_on | Starts the camera streaming images and sets the interval between images and an optional number of images to stream.  Does not return anything but the camera will start generating image responses. |
| set\_stream_off | Stops the camera from streaming images. |
| get_wifi | Returns a packet with the camera's current WiFi and Network configuration. |
| set_wifi | Set the camera's WiFi and Network configuration.  The WiFi subsystem is immediately restarted.  The application should immediately close its socket after sending this command.  Does not return anything. |
| fw\_update_request | Informs the camera of a OTA FW update size and revision and starts it blinking the LED alternating between red and green to signal to the user a OTA FW update has been requested. |
| fw\_segment | Sends a sequential chunk of the new FW during an OTA FW update. |

The camera generates the following responses.

| --- | --- |
| length | Length of binary file in bytes. |
| version | Binary file version.  This must match the build version embedded in the binary file. |

#### get_fw

```
{
  "get_fw":{
    "start":0,
    "length":8192
  }
}
```

| get_fw argument Item | Description |

```
{
  "cmd":"fw_segment",
  "args":{
    "start":0,
    "length":8192,
    "data":"6QYCMPwUCEDuAAAAAAADAAAAAAAAAAABIABAPwjEAQAyVM2rAAAAAAAAA..."
  }
}
```

| fw_segment Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| start | Starting byte of current chunk. |
| length | Length of chunk in bytes. |
| data | Base64 encoded binary data chunk. |

#### Streaming (and a performance note)
Streaming is a slightly special case for the command interface.  Responses are only generated after receiving the associated get command.  However the image response is generated repeatedly by the camera after streaming has been enabled at the rate, and for the number of times, specified in the set\_stream\_on command.

While the task that services the Lepton is capable of getting the maximum 8.7 fps frame-rate out of the sensor, the task generating the image response and sending it through the ESP32's network and Wifi stacks may not always keep up.  It appears that the time required to send the data over the ESP32's Wifi interface varies depending on a several factors.

Typical streaming rates vary from about 6-9 fps.  The fps display on the desktop application will dip every time the Lepton performs a FFC because it is averaging over several seconds and the camera stops sending images during the FFC (about 1.5 seconds).
 
### OTA FW Update Process
The OTA FW update process consists of several steps.  The FW is contained in the binary file ```tCamMini.bin``` in the precompiled FW directory or built using the Espressif IDF.  No other binary files are required.

1. An external computer initiates the update process by sending a ```fw_update_request```.
2. The camera starts blinking the LED in an alternating red/green pattern to indicate a FW update has been requested.  The user must press the Wifi Reset Button to confirm the update should proceed.
3. The camera sends a ```get_fw``` to request a chunk of data from the computer.
4. The computer sends a ```fw_segment``` with the requested data.
5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated until the entire firmware binary file has been transferred.
6. The camera validates the binary file and sends a ```cam\_info``` indicating if the update is successful or has failed.  If successful the camera then reboots into the new firmware.


### Prototype
My first tCam-Mini was built using a Sparkfun ESP32 Thing+ and a Lepton Breakout board from Group Gets.  I added an external PSRAM for more buffer space and a red/green LED (with current limiting resistors).  The GPIO0 button is the WiFi Reset Button.

![tCam-Mini Prototype](pictures/tcam_mini_prototype.png)

A hand-drawn schematic can be found in the pictures directory here (tcam\_mini\_proto\_schem.pdf) if you'd like to try to build one without the hassle of making a PCB and soldering SMT parts.  

### Building with dev boards
I found the [TTGO T7 V1.4](http://www.lilygo.cn/prod_view.aspx?TypeId=50033&Id=978&FId=t3:50033:3) ESP32 WROVER based development board long after I started this project but it's a good way, along with a [Lepton Breakout](https://store.groupgets.com/products/purethermal-breakout-board) from Group Gets, to even more easily build a tCam-Mini without having to make and load a PCB.  The PSRAM is already part of the WROVER module simplifying the build considerably.

You can use other ESP32 development boards, just make sure they have a 4 or 8 MB PSRAM (WROVER-based).

You'll also need the following components.

* Small proto board to build on.  I used a commonly available 4x6cm board.
* 5 10-pin 0.1" headers (4 for the TTGO V7 and 1 for the Lepton Breakout).
* A small tactile push button.
* A dual Red-Green common-cathode LED (I use a Lite-On LTL1BEKVJNN).
* Two 180-330 ohm resistors, 1/8 - 1/4 watt.
* Optional electrolytic capacitor.  This should only be necessary if there is a voltage drop when the Lepton performs a FFC causing it to malfunction.

The components are wired together as shown below.

| 23 | Lepton I2C SDA |

#### ESP Revision Note
The modules I buy from Mouser and that Group Gets sources for the PCB design include a Rev 3 ESP32 chip and I compile for that version.  I found that the TTGO module had a Rev 1 ESP32 chip so I also recompiled the project for Rev 1.  The binary files for that revision can also be found in the firmware/precompiled subdirectory.  The camera won't boot if you use the wrong chip revision.

The PCB versions have 8 MB Flash modules (64 MBit) but the TTGO module is 4 MB (32 MBit).  Be sure to properly configure the flash size in the programmer to match your module or the firmware will fail to boot.  This is explained in the programming sub-directory readme.
